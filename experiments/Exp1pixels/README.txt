I ran 100 participants out of 250, before noticing that unlike in the pilot sample, the proportion of hidden pixels has very little effect on sensitivity and response times in target-present trials. 
Furthermore, due to a coding error, the number of hidden pixels was not 0.05 or 0.10 as planned, but could go as low as 0 on some trials. (line 205 in plugin-noisy-letter.js). 
I now fixed this coding error, so the number of hidden pixels is fixed. To increase the effect size in target-present trials so that it is closer to the effect of 150 ms we observe for context in Exp. 2,
I also changed the proportion of hidden pixels to 0.05 versus 0.15, instead of 0.05 versus 0.10 as it was before.
